# Forecasting the Number of Electric Vehicles in Washington State Using ARIMA Time Series Analysis

## Introduction
In this modern era, technology is developing more and more rapidly. The emergence of electric vehicles adds another "choice" to society in choosing the type of vehicle to buy/use. Therefore, it is important to know the trends in the use of electric vehicles. In this project, we will use Electric Vehicle Title and Registration Activity data to model the number of electric vehicles in Washington state.

## Data
We used Washington State's [dataset of electric vehicle title and registration activity](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-title-and-registration-activity) [accessed on August 24, 2023] which included a total of 781,713 transactions.
